Top 10 Most Insane Things ChatGPT Has Done This Week

OpenAI already made a splash this year with its image generator DALL-E, and now the progressive artificial intelligence company has done it again with the release of its newest AI chatbot, ChatGPT. 

For the past week, over a million users have been testing out the limits of ChatGPT and receiving a mixture of amazing, nonsensical, and useful responses. From silly stories to college-level essays, we’ve collected 10 of the best examples so far and tried out a few prompts ourselves, so you can see just how mind-blowing this chatbot is.

What Is ChatGPT?
Sure, we could tell you what ChatGTP is ourselves, but why would we do that when it can introduce itself perfectly well?

As the Assistant explained, ChatGPT is a large language model trained by the San Francisco company OpenAI. It has been trained on text information covering a variety of subjects, but its knowledge only goes up to the end of 2021 and it can’t access the internet to find new information. 

One of the biggest differences between this chat AI and others we’ve seen in the past is its amazing ability to remember information from previous messages and write replies that draw on the context of the entire conversation. 

It can also produce far more natural and accurate language than other publicly-available AI, and in most cases, it’s pretty indistinguishable from text written by a native human speaker.

Top 10 Most Insane Things ChatGTP Has Said This Week
Here’s a collection of crazy examples showing what ChatGTP can do and how people have been using it in the week since its release.

Nonsensical Prompts
When it comes to generating random text covering a certain topic in a certain style, ChatGPT can seemingly produce just about anything you want. 

The Biblical Verse
A popular example from Twitter shows someone asking the bot to write a biblical verse explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR. 

The response is undeniably on point and just as nonsensical as it should be. It makes sense that the bot was trained on something as famous and significant as the Bible, but it seems it was also given information on how to retrieve items from inside a VCR. 

The Egg-Turned-Drawing-Tool
Here’s one of our own prompts, asking the chatbot to write about a person trying to sell an egg as a drawing tool. As you can see, it’s possible to keep adding new information and asking for revisions, so you can fine-tune the output and get exactly what you want. 

While ChatGPT is trained to decline inappropriate requests, random, pointless, and nonsensical prompts are not considered inappropriate. You can spend as long as you want asking for the strangest things you can think of, and ChatGPT will remain polite and helpful the entire time. 

The chatbot’s ability to remember the entire conversation means you can delve deeper and deeper into a topic, and it will always give neutral, polite, and context-appropriate responses. This has actually led to a few people trying out therapy sessions with the bot and reporting surprisingly positive results. 

Useful Prompts
However, creating coherent yet nonsensical responses isn’t the only thing ChatGPT can do. With the sheer amount of information at its fingertips, this chatbot can help you with cooking recipes, essay work, coding, and studying. 

The DeBugging Companion
The chat site includes coding instructions as a potential example prompt to try out, and people have been doing just that. This example shows ChatGPT accurately explaining a bug, fixing it, and explaining the fix.

But when it comes to coding, ChatGPT isn’t always correct. Stack Overflow was forced to temporarily ban users from sharing responses generated by the AI because such a high percentage was incorrect. 

Cases like this remind us that ChatGPT doesn’t actually know how to code or know that it is coding; it’s simply bringing together related information and assembling it in a way that mimics existing examples. 

The Dairy-Free Mac and Cheese
It’s also possible to enlist ChatGTP’s help with cooking recipes. By creating a prompt including the dish you want to make and any dietary requirements you have, it’ll respond with a general-purpose recipe.


Of course, there’s no guarantee that the result will be accurate and usable, so it’s best to give it a read-through first before turning your stove on. 

As easy as it is to simply search Google for a recipe, it could also be nice to avoid the process of checking through multiple options and struggling to work out which is best. Plus, Google can sometimes ignore half of your keywords and still give you recipes that include ingredients you can’t eat. 

The A- Essay
This user on Twitter gave the AI an essay prompt from their history class and received a reply they considered to be “solid A- work.” Since ChatGPT can produce such natural language and accurate content, it’s a genuine possibility that technology of this type could put an end to the current college essay.
